# ML_Project_Grocery-cart-Analysis
Due to the pandemic, more people prefer to work from home and shop for groceries online. However, online retailers are facing issues such as limited filtering options and unhelpful suggestions. This is affecting their ability to thrive in the current environment. The research goal is to develop user segments and a framework for product recommendations based on user preferences. The study aims to enhance inventory distribution on the supply side and increase the probability of buyers receiving essential goods while maintaining social distance. The objectives of the project are to suggest products to users based on their prior purchases and determine if a previously purchased product will be included in their upcoming order.Â
